		<h1>SP Environmental Sustainability</h1>
		<p>At SP, we are committed to environmental sustainability and taking actions to reduce our ecological footprint. Here are some initiatives we have undertaken:</p>

		<h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
		<p>We have installed solar panels on our campuses, harnessing clean and renewable energy to power our buildings. This helps to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and lower greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

		<h2>Waste Management</h2>
		<p>We have implemented comprehensive waste management systems across our campuses. This includes recycling programs, composting initiatives, and reducing single-use plastics. We actively promote recycling and proper waste disposal among our students and staff.</p>

		<h2>Green Buildings</h2>
		<p>Our new building constructions follow sustainable design principles, incorporating energy-efficient features, natural lighting, and green spaces. We aim to create a conducive learning environment while minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact.</p>

		<h2>Environmental Education</h2>
		<p>We believe in educating our students about environmental issues and promoting sustainability. We offer courses and workshops on environmental studies, renewable energy, and conservation practices. We also organize awareness campaigns and community projects to engage students in environmental initiatives.</p>
