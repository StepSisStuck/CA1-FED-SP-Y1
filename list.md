Taking a stroll along one of SP's many footpaths, you would find yourself immersed in greenery and nature—promoting relaxation, reducing stress and anxiety, and providing an instant mood boost.

When the foundation stone of our beautiful campus was laid, we have sought to integrate our buildings with its natural surroundings rather than replace them. We have also documented 230 species of flora on campus including our majestic Brown Woolly Fig Heritage Trees found near Food Court 1.
We pledge to green our
campus, reduce our environmental
impact and nurture stewards
